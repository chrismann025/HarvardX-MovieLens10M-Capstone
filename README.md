# HarvardX-MovieLens10M-Capstone
MovieLens 10M Capstone for HarvardX Data Science Certificate

NOTE:

CMANN-Capstone-MovieLens10M.R - Includes all code for all models

CMANN-Capstone-MovieLens10M-RMSE_SCORING.R - This is a small file that only includes the code required to generate the datasets and then train and test one model for RMSE scoring

EXTRA NOTE: Looking at the Discussion section, it appears that we don't need to do the scoring against the "rubric.csv" file (it's just the validation set but with only that userId, movieId, and rating columns).  Anyway, the code is in there to calcualte the RMSE against the validation set and against the rubric.

At this point we shouldn't be surprised that the insturctions aren't clear... cheers!  ;)
